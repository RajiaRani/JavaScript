//Number:  Unlike other programming languages, you donâ€™t need int, float, etc to declare different numeric values.
// You can defined any numbers here.
//In which can handle both INTEGER and Floating-point (decimal) values.

//Note: you can apply any method on any numbers.
let number1 = 45;
let number2 = 4545;
let sum = number1+number2;
let div = number2/number1;
let multi = number1*number2;
console.log(`Sum = ` + sum);
console.log(`Multiplication = ` + multi);
console.log(`Division = ` + div);
//Note you can also use the function or method dirctly in the console
console.log(`Modulo is = ` + number1%number2);


// Example 2
let x = 89;
let y = 77;
let divideByTwo = (x+y)/2;
console.log(divideByTwo);
